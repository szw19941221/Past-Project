The name of my geoprocessing tool is : “ Reclassify_Vector_Data_458_Sun” and here is the link of my tool:
https://geog-gs01.geog.uw.edu:6443/arcgis/manager/#f=458-Sun.

Also, in the folder of “ Geoprocessing tool; Zhengwei Sun, I have included two maps after using reclassify; one of them is King county while another is Washington State. However, the classification interval used in the map of King county is not suitable in Washington State because I use POP2016 as the input field and large portion of the map are out of range.
