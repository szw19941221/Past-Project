This map dispalys cities in China that has more than 10million population. There are couple things that can be improve; 1) I was trying to
setup the boundary for each city using Mapbox API but the application(named Komodo) I use in order to achieve this is expired, 2) it will be better if I change these points into polygon and it will help readers to understand the size of the city with population.

There isn't really much reason why I chose I display this map like this because there are point feature. However, I did change the color
of points into blue in order highlight the points on the map because the background is kind dark. I also changed the color of water into ligher gray in order to highlight the land. The overall effect I thought about this map would be points with stand-out color and a popup for each point with city name and metro_population. In fact, I made it but not as good as I thought. Since there are only 16 points in this map and it is not really necessary to set my map work at different level. 

I actually got help from mapbox API documentation for the popup part: URL: https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/popup/
For the html inside the popup, I learned a little bit about html before. But, still borrowed some help using the same ducumentation: https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/popup/
